# Numerical Analysis

The codes in this repo were implemented to solve an exercise list for discipline of Numerical Analysis. Each code is descripted below.

* `Teste_MMQ_2019.m`: Algorithm to approximate a function using Least Squares Method (when vector `w` is filled with ones) or Weighted Least Squares Method (`w` with different values).

* `Teste_MMQM_2019.m`: Algorithm to approximate a function using Moving Least Squares Method (when vector `w` is filled with ones) or Moving Weighted Least Squares Method (`w` with different values).

* `MMQ_2019.m`: Function that returns the alpha values used on MLS and WMLS methods.
